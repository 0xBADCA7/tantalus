# Tantalus
Alternative cross-platform client for Evernote built in Electron.

# Work in progress
Please note this is still a work in progress.

# Goals
The primary goal of this project is to build a minimalist alternative Evernote client that runs natively in Linux.

There are a few working Evernote clients for Linux but I believe we can create something faster and easier to maintain in [Electron](http://github.com/atom/electron).
